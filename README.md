# PCBdesign
Welcome to the PCBdesign wiki!

I'm sharing here my PCB design projects.
The first one is a STM32F103C8T6 Bluepill clone. Everything the same but with THT components.
More vesions is comming soon... My plane is to design a similar board with an ESP32 controller support.
After I will try designing boards with more robust controllers which are cabale to run Linux.
I would like to use these boards for vision and machine learning projects with wifi and remote programming support.

So here is my Bluepill clone:
